A very simple scene to demonstrate how to integrate Threejs WebGPU with React Three Fiber using Post Processing effects.
[See the demo here](https://r3f-webgpu-post-processing.vercel.app/)

### Getting Started using this demo project

Download and install Node.js on your computer (https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Then, open VSCODE, drag the project folder to it. Open VSCODE terminal and install dependencies (you need to do this only in the first time)
